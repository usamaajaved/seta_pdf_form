SetaPDF Installation
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
The main files of all SetaPDF components are located in the folder "library/SetaPDF/".

The SetaPDF components come with an own autoload function which will register itself in the spl provided __autoload
stack by simply requiring the Autoload.php file:

    require_once('path/to/library/SetaPDF/Autoload.php');

After that you can use all classes without requiring any file manually.

The documentation and demos folders are not needed for productive usage.


FOR EVALUATION VERSIONS ONLY
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
An evaluation package is encoded with Zend Guard or Ioncube.
Both versions require a kind of loader to be installed on your server.

An evaluation version is seperated into two parts: The PHP files and a license file.

License files are named .htSetaPDF-<COMPONENT-NAME>.icl (for Ioncube) or .htSetaPDF-<COMPONENT-NAME>.zl (for Zend Guard)

    NOTICE THE DOT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FILENAME!
    SOME SYSTEMS (e.g. MAC) AUTOMATICALLY HIDE SUCH FILES!

Depending on the version you'd choosen read the following installation instructions:

    Ioncube
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    The needed loaders and install instruction for the Ioncube Loader are available at:
    http://www.ioncube.com/loaders.php

    Place the license file into the root folder "library/SetaPDF/"


    Zend Guard
    ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
    To run Zend Guard encoded files you'll need the Zend Optimizer (PHP 5.2) or the Zend Guard Loader (PHP 5.3) to be
    installed on your server. It is available for download at: http://www.zend.com/products/guard/downloads

    Following PHP code shall be used to load the license file at runtime:

        zend_loader_install_license([absolute_path_to_the_licensefile], true);

    The download package of an evaluation license includes a PHP file (loadLicense.php) that includes the above line,
    so that you just have to require the file and the license will be loaded automatically.

    It is also possible to load a license file via an entry in the php.ini:

        zend_optimizer.licence_path = [path_to_the_licensefile(s)]
        or
        zend_loader.license_path = [path_to_the_licensefile(s)]
        (make sure you restart your webserver)
